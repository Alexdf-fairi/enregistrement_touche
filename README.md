# Keyboard Calibration Project

This project uses OpenCV to calibrate keyboard key positions from an image and generate a list of key centers. The script detects key positions and outputs the coordinates of their centers.

## Features

- Detects key positions from an image of a keyboard.
- Calculates the center of each key and displays the coordinates.
- Visualizes the detected key centers on the original image.
- Outputs a numbered list of key centers for further use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keyboard-calibration.git
   cd keyboard-calibration
